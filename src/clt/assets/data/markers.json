Arriving there, he found that the 7th Rifle Regiment had succeeded in getting one rifle company across the river, but under the intense enemy fire the crossing equipment had been shot to pieces and the crossing had to be halted. Rommel realised that he could not get any more men over at this time. He intended to arrange tank and artillery support and drove off to the division headquarters. After making the necessary arrangements he drove off to Leffe, just north of Dinant. Here the crossing had been stopped, but the tanks and field howitzers Rommel had ordered forward soon arrived and with the covering fire, the crossing got going again. Rommel took command of\nthe 2nd Battalion of the 7th Rifle Regiment and personally directed the operations for some time and also crossed the river in one of the first boats.","lat":"50.27159882","lng":"4.90349674","place":"Leffe","country":"Belgium","date":"1940-05-13","source":"","remarks":"","published":"0","created_at":"2019-01-27 23:53:36","updated_at":"2019-01-27 23:53:36"}, {"id":"189","typeId":"1","name":"LonlaylAbbaye01","shortdesc":"","info":"US halftracks moving through a ruined street in Lonlay L' Abbaye.
