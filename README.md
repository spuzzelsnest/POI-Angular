# POI-Angular

Angular remake of a former project from 2007. An interactive map with POI's in Angular with Experess backend.

The Map is based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/50.510/4.475) and I use the [Leaflet Plugin](https://leafletjs.com/) to create the markers and the clusters.
